# website-from-scratch

This is a website that I'm building from scratch, i.e. with as few dependencies as possible (maybe for the database I'll use a library).

If I finish this project maybe I'll do a library on NPM.

### Dependencies

- NodeJS
- TypeScript
- @types/node

Package manager: PNPM
