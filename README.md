# website-from-scratch

This is a website that I'm building from scratch, i.e. with as few dependencies as possible (maybe for the database I'll use a library).

If I finish this project maybe I'll do a library on NPM.

Please note that this is a project made for educational purposes, so please do not use it to build a production website.

### Dependencies

- NodeJS
- sqlite3 (here I use a third-party library but NodeJS plans to add an equivalent on next versions so maybe I'll uninstall this and implement the database handling a second time.)
- TypeScript
- @types/node
- bcrypt and jsonwebtoken: I use these packages for safety reasons
- @paralleldrive/cuid2: random id generator

Package manager: PNPM
