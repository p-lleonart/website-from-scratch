# TODO

Features:
- auth & csrf (check safety & cleaning token system)
- setup project for node 22 (suppress sqlite3 dependency)
- improve middleware logic
- better error handling
- new features: files, sessions, i18n, cache,...
- move user's files into app directory (the files that the user must create/edit to do a website are in this folder, except templates & public. DONT FORGET TO MOVE routes.ts TOO)
